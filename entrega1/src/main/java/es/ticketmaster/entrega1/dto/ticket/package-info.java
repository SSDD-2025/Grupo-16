/**
 * This package contains the Data Transfer Object (DTO) for the Ticket entity,
 * along with its corresponding Mapper.
 *
 * The DTO facilitates the transfer of ticket-related data between different layers of the application,
 * promoting separation between the domain model and external representations.
 *
 * The Mapper is responsible for converting between the Ticket domain model and its DTO,
 * ensuring consistent and maintainable data transformations.
