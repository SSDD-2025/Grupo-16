/**
 * This package contains Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) related to the Concert entity,
 * as well as a corresponding Mapper.
 *
 * The DTOs are used to transfer concert-related data between different layers of the application,
 * allowing the internal domain model to remain decoupled from external representations.
 *
 * The Mapper handles the conversion between the domain model and the DTOs,
 * providing a clean and consistent transformation in both directions.
