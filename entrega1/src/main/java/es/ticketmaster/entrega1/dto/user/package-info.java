/**
 * This package contains the Data Transfer Object (DTO) for the User entity,
 * along with its corresponding Mapper.
 *
 * The DTO is used to transfer user-related data between different layers of the application,
 * helping to decouple the internal domain model from external representations.
 *
 * The Mapper is responsible for converting between the domain model and the DTO,
 * ensuring a clean and consistent transformation in both directions.
